# Traveling Salesman Problem Solver using Simulated Annealing
This Python script solves the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using the Simulated Annealing algorithm. It calculates the shortest tour that visits a set of cities and returns to the starting city. The code includes functions to calculate the distance between cities, perform simulated annealing, and plot the best tour on a graph.

## Usage
Define the coordinates of the cities in the cities list.
Run the script to find the optimized tour using simulated annealing.
The output will display the best tour and its total cost.
The best tour will be plotted on a graph, showing the optimized path.
